          <QA q="My opponent didn't respond after matching. What now?">
            Cancel the match and move on — the cancel button is there for exactly this. If it
            keeps happening with the same player, report them.
          </QA>
          <QA q="I only reported and my opponent never did. Does the match still count?">
            Yes. If your opponent never reports, your report is accepted automatically 24 hours
            after the match started, and they&apos;re charged a no-show. If neither of you
            reports within 24 hours, the match closes with no rating change for either player.
          </QA>
          <QA q="I reported the wrong winner by mistake.">
            Report again with the correct result before your opponent reports — the two of you
            just need to agree. If reports already disagree, the match goes to a mod as a
            dispute.
          </QA>
          <QA q="My opponent reported a different winner than what actually happened.">
            Don&apos;t just resubmit and hope — this puts the match in a disputed state where a
            mod steps in to resolve it based on both reports. If it was deliberate, file a
            conduct report too.
          </QA>
          <QA q="My rating didn't change after a confirmed match.">
            Rounding can occasionally produce a 0-point change at the extreme ends of a rating
            gap — that&apos;s expected, not a bug. If both reports clearly matched and the winner
            looks wrong on your profile, report the match as a dispute.
          </QA>
        </Category>

        <Category title="Practicing">
          <QA q="Why can't I pick my main character?">
            You queued that match with &quot;Practicing&quot; checked — your reported main
            character is banned for you for that set specifically. Uncheck &quot;Practicing&quot;
            next time you join the queue if you want your full roster available.
          </QA>
          <QA q="Does a practicing match affect my ladder rating?">
            No. Practicing results go entirely to a separate practice rating — your regular
            ladder rating and games-played count don&apos;t move, whether you win or lose.
          </QA>
          <QA q="I didn't mean to check Practicing — can I turn it off mid-match?">
            No, it&apos;s locked in for that match once you&apos;re paired. Cancel the match if
            it&apos;s still early enough (see &quot;Canceling a match&quot; above), or ask your opponent to agree
            to a mutual cancel from the match screen, then requeue with the box unchecked.
          </QA>
        </Category>

        <Category title="Character reporting">
          <QA q="My character isn't showing on my profile.">
            It only shows once an opponent reports it after a match — there&apos;s no self-select.
            If you just finished a match, give it a moment; if it&apos;s been a while, your opponent
            may not have reported it.
          </QA>
          <QA q="Someone reported the wrong character for me.">
            One bad report won&apos;t meaningfully skew anything — the character leaderboard looks at
            reports in aggregate. If you think it&apos;s a deliberate pattern of bad-faith reporting,
            file a conduct report on that player.
          </QA>
        </Category>

        <Category title="Conduct, reports, and account status">
          <QA q="Someone was toxic to me outside of a match — Discord DMs, stream chat, etc.">
            The report system covers conduct connected to ranked matches on this site. For
            anything off-platform, block them and, if it&apos;s serious, report it to Discord
            directly.
          </QA>
          <QA q="I reported someone — will you tell me what happened to them?">
            No. We don&apos;t disclose moderation outcomes on individual reports, mainly so reporters
            aren&apos;t identifiable and targeted for retaliation. Filing a report is still the right
            move even without visible confirmation — a single report rarely results in action by
            itself, but a pattern does.
          </QA>
          <QA q="My account was suspended or banned. Why, and can I appeal?">
            We don&apos;t publish the specific reports behind a status change, for the same
            retaliation-prevention reason above. If you think it&apos;s a mistake, reach out to a mod
            or admin in the{" "}
            <a href="https://discord.gg/zE8B44vQxf" className="underline" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">
              community Discord server
            </a>{" "}
            — appeals go through them, not through the report system.
          </QA>
          <QA q="What's the actual difference between suspended and banned?">
            Suspended (Level 1) still lets you play ranked — that&apos;s the core activity, and
            disputes already give bad results their own path to correction — but blocks free
            battle and filing new reports, so a suspended player can&apos;t retaliate against whoever
            reported them. Banned (Level 2) blocks everything.
          </QA>
        </Category>

        <Category title="Account">
          <QA q="How do I delete my account?">
            From your profile page, under &quot;Danger zone.&quot; It scrubs your username,
            avatar, and email immediately. See the{" "}
            <a href="/privacy" className="underline">
              Privacy Policy
            </a>{" "}
            for exactly what&apos;s kept and why.
          </QA>
          <QA q="Can I undo an account deletion, or merge it into a new account?">
            No — deletion is permanent and there&apos;s no data migration between accounts. Signing
            back in with the same Discord account afterward just starts a fresh profile.
          </QA>
          <QA q="Is matchmaking open worldwide?">
            Yes — anyone can join. Set your region and a match distance on the Lobby page; the
            defaults match you with same-or-nearby-region players, and you can widen that up to
            Worldwide if you&apos;d rather queue faster. See the Rules page for exactly how the
            distance setting works.
          </QA>
        </Category>

        <Category title="Seasons">
          <QA q="What happens to my rating when a season ends?">
            Standings get snapshotted, then rating and games-played reset for everyone at the
            start of the next season — a clean slate rather than a partial regression, so every
            season starts on equal footing.
          </QA>
        </Category>

        <Category title="Community & moderation">
          <QA q="Is there a Discord server?">
            Yes —{" "}
            <a href="https://discord.gg/zE8B44vQxf" className="underline" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">
              join here
            </a>
            . It&apos;s where to hang out, report site issues, or reach a mod/admin (e.g. for a
            ban appeal).
          </QA>
          <QA q="How is moderation staffed?">
            Around 5 mods/admins currently, selected on a volunteer basis. If you&apos;re
            interested in helping out, reach out in the Discord server above.
          </QA>
          <QA q="Is this affiliated with Japan's Smash Ladder / Smashmate?">
            No — this is an independent, separately-run project built for the NA scene. Any
            naming similarity to existing Japanese matchmaking platforms is coincidental.
